The key defining property of interlocking assemblies is that all component parts are immobilized by their geometric arrangement, preventing the assembly from falling apart. Computer graphics research has recently contributed design tools that allow creating new interlocking assemblies. However, these tools focus on specific kinds of assemblies and explore only a limited space of interlocking configurations, which restricts their applicability for design. In this paper, we propose a new general framework for designing interlocking assemblies. The core idea is to represent part relationships with a family of base Directional Blocking Graphs and leverage efficient graph analysis tools to compute an interlocking arrangement of parts. This avoids the exponential complexity of brute-force search. Our algorithm iteratively constructs the geometry of assembly components, taking advantage of all existing blocking relations for constructing successive parts. As a result, our approach supports a wider range of assembly forms compared to previous methods and provides significantly more design flexibility. We show that our framework facilitates efficient design of complex interlocking assemblies, including new solutions that cannot be achieved by state of the art approaches.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"DESIA: A General Framework for Designing Interlocking Assemblies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Ziq Wang**","Jack Szu-Shen Chen","Jimin Joy","Hsi-Yung Feng"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1558915200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1558915200,"objectID":"55bf1abd77e26adc14fb1bcc89c150ac","permalink":"/publication/machined-sharp-edge-restoration/","publishdate":"2018-04-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/machined-sharp-edge-restoration/","section":"publication","summary":"Grid-based machining simulation methods have become very popular due to their advantages in computational efficiency. However, these methods are prone to generating machined workpiece models with chamfer edges, which reduce model accuracy and visual quality. An effective method is presented in this paper targeting the restoration of machined edges from these chamfer edges for triangle mesh models derived from grid-based machining simulation. The method starts by detecting the chamfer edge triangles via utilizing both edge-based mesh segmentation and feature-based mesh segmentation. The outcomes of the two segmentation methods are then compared and combined to achieve improved detection accuracy. To restore the machined edges, the detected chamfer edge triangles are split by adding new points based on the neighbors of the chamfer edge triangles. Triangle quality checks are imposed during the point addition process in order to ensure that the restored edges do not negatively impact the triangle mesh quality. Once all the applicable new points are added for all the chamfer edge triangles, the edge restoration task is complete. The presented method has been implemented and executed on sample triangle mesh models derived from grid-based machining simulation. Improved edge restoration compared to that of existing edge restoration methods has been observed. Sub-second computational performance is attained for the majority of the test cases.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Machined Sharp Edge Restoration For Triangle Mesh Workpiece Models Derived From Grid-Based Machining Simulation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Peng Song","Bailin Deng","**Ziq Wang**","Zhichao Dong","Wei Li","Chi-Wing Fu","Ligang Liu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1558828800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1558828800,"objectID":"a8c32cedeaff84db26ded223543eef40","permalink":"/publication/cofifab/","publishdate":"2016-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cofifab/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper presents CofiFab, a coarse-to-fine 3D fabrication solution, combining 3D printing and 2D laser cutting for cost-effective fabrication of large objects at lower cost and higher speed. Our key approach is to first build coarse internal base structures within the given 3D object using laser cutting, and then attach thin 3D-printed parts, as an external shell, onto the base to recover the fine surface details. CofiFab achieves this with three novel algorithmic components. First, we formulate an optimization model to compute fabricatable polyhedrons of maximized volume, as the geometry of the internal base. Second, we devise a new interlocking scheme to tightly connect the laser-cut parts into a strong internal base, by iteratively building a network of nonorthogonal joints and interlocking parts around polyhedral corners. Lastly, we optimize the partitioning of the external object shell into 3D-printable parts, while saving support material and avoiding overhangs. Besides cost saving, these components also consider aesthetics, stability and balancing. Hence, CofiFab can efficiently produce large objects by assembly. To evaluate CofiFab, we fabricate objects of varying shapes and sizes, and show that CofiFab can significantly outperform previous methods.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"CofiFab: Coarse-to-Fine Fabrication of Large 3D Objects","type":"publication"}]
